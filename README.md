Hello, I'm Brandon.

I’m an interdisciplinary artist working across **film, sound, design, and systems**—exploring how ideas become real through experience, storytelling, and structure. From creating immersive art installations to engineering autonomous tools, my work lives at the intersection of **culture, technology, and design**.
