# Brandon Nelson  

Hi, I’m Brandon — an artist, engineer, and founder working at the intersection of **technology, design, and culture**.  
I’m building projects that merge technology, creative practice, and education into a new model for the future.

## ⚡ Current Focus

### **San Diego Institute of Technology (SDIT)**
I founded **SDIT** to reimagine higher education for the 21st century.  
Think *Bell Labs meets a modern liberal arts renaissance* — a place where engineers, artists, and builders come together to create technologies, ideas, and cultural movements that matter.  

- **Mission**: hands-on, world-class education that is affordable, interdisciplinary, and relevant.  
- **Focus Areas**:  
  - Defense Engineering & Unmanned Systems (DEUS)  
  - Creative Intelligence & Interdisciplinary Arts  
  - Mental Models, Systems Thinking, and Liberal Education 2.0  
- **Goal**: Build the most advanced talent-producing and research-driven institution of the post-industrial era.

## 🛰️ Big Projects  

- **Terminal 82** → a creative studio/lab housing music, film, design, and counterculture projects.  
- **Coyote Radio** → a psychedelic rock project and storytelling universe exploring authenticity in a digital age.  
- **Expedition Provisions** → coffee as cultural fuel, funding art, travel, and adventure.  

Each of these projects connects back into SDIT — advancing the vision of a **post-industrial renaissance** where technology, creativity, and integrity align.

## 🌊 Vision  

I believe we’re entering a new era — a **Post-Industrial Renaissance**.  
Where craftsmanship, creativity, and engineering combine to:  

- Build technologies that defend and protect.  
- Create art that inspires people to live intentionally.  
- Educate a new generation to tune into a deeper frequency of life.  

I’m focused on not just as ideas, but as products, institutions, and movements that exist in the world.
