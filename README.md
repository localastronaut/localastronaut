# Brandon Nelson

Hi, I’m Brandon — an **interdisciplinary artist and engineer** working at the intersection of technology, design, and culture.  
I build projects that merge technology, creative practice, and education into a new model for the future.

## 🚀 Current Focus  

### [San Diego Institute of Technology (SDIT)](https://github.com/San-Diego-Institute-of-Technology/)  

I founded SDIT to reimagine higher education for the 21st century.  
Think *Bell Labs meets a modern liberal arts renaissance* — a place where engineers, artists, and builders collaborate to create technologies, ideas, and cultural movements that matter.  

- **Mission:** Hands-on, world-class education that is affordable, interdisciplinary, and relevant.  
- **Focus Areas:**  
  - Department of Engineering & Unmanned Systems (DEUS)  
  - Creative Intelligence & Interdisciplinary Arts  
  - Mental Models, Systems Thinking, and Liberal Education 2.0  
- **Goal:** Build the most advanced talent-producing, research-driven institution of the post-industrial era.
